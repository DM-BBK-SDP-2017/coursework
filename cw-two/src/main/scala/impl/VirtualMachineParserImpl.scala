/**
  * To do this you will first need to write an adapter that adapts the vendor parser and bytecode parser with a virtual
  * parser that transforms a textual bytecode program into a vector of bytecode objects. You
  * do this by implementing a vm.VirtualMachineParser. That is, you should implement
  * vm.VirtualMachineParser as the adapter â€” use composition of the other two parsers
  * as part of your implementation.
  *
  * After you complete the virtual machine parser you can implement a vm.VirtualMachine.
  * Your virtual machine implementation should use some internal representation for a stack
  * and provide the correct operations defined by the vm.VirtualMachine trait.
  * Lastly, modify factory.VirtualMachineFactory to return an instance of your virtual
  * machine from the virtualMachine method.
